# Preliminary Program

#### Date: Friday, June 23, 2023
#### Venue: Regency E


### Session 1: 
* 8:30      
    Opening & Welcome
* 8:40 - 9:35   
    Keynote 1: Olya Ohrimenko  
    Title: Verifiable Machine Unlearning: Was I really forgotten?  
    *Abstract: The right to be forgotten entitles individuals to request for their data to be deleted by a service provider who collects their data. Since data is often used to train machine learning models (e.g., to improve user experience), Machine Unlearning has been proposed as a way to remove data points from a model. However, how does the user know that the service provider indeed executed Machine Unlearning? The problem is not trivial as model parameters may be the same before and after data deletion. In this talk, I propose to view Machine Unlearning as a security problem. To this end, I will give an overview of the first cryptographic definition of verifiable unlearning that formally captures the guarantees of a machine unlearning system. I will then show one possible instantiation of this general definition based on cryptographic assumptions and protocols, using SNARKs and hash chains. I will conclude my talk with open questions including consequences of unlearning for data privacy.*
    
    *This talk is based on joint work with Thorsten Eisenhofer, Doreen Riepel, Varun Chandrasekaran, Esha Ghosh and Nicolas Papernot.*
    
* 9:35 - 10:30      
    Keynote 2: Dumitrel Loghin (National University of Singapore)    
    Title: Practical Use Cases of Blockchain and Verifiable Databases in the Industry

    *Abstract: In this talk, I will start with an overview of Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP), which is a national programme supported by the National Research Foundation of Singapore through a S$12 million grant for 3 years. SBIP has three key objectives: (i) working with local Singaporean companies in adopting blockchain technology through Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value projects, (ii) developing the blockchain ecosystem in Singapore and (iii) conducting research into the next-generation of blockchain technologies. Next, I will present a few use cases where SBIP worked with companies in researching and implementing Proofs-of-Concept projects. The domains of these projects include FinTech, supply chain, asset management, and cybersecurity. Finally, I will present some of the challenges companies face in adopting blockchain and some future directions.*
