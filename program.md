    Title: Practical Use Cases of Blockchain and Verifiable Databases in the Industry

    *Abstract: In this talk, I will start with an overview of Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP), which is a national programme supported by the National Research Foundation of Singapore through a S$12 million grant for 3 years. SBIP has three key objectives: (i) working with local Singaporean companies in adopting blockchain technology through Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value projects, (ii) developing the blockchain ecosystem in Singapore and (iii) conducting research into the next-generation of blockchain technologies. Next, I will present a few use cases where SBIP worked with companies in researching and implementing Proofs-of-Concept projects. The domains of these projects include FinTech, supply chain, asset management, and cybersecurity. Finally, I will present some of the challenges companies face in adopting blockchain and some future directions.*
