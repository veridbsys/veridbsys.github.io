## Overview
As most of today’s data lives in the cloud, security is crucial because the cloud databases
are run by potentially malicious third parties. For many applications, integrity of the data, and
of the operations on the data are important, if not more than data secrecy. A verifiable
database system ensures that a user is given a strong integrity guarantee, that is, the
operation is executed correctly over untampered data. While general-purpose verifiable
computation techniques do exist, they involve heavy use of expensive cryptographic
primitives, therefore suffering from poor performance and cannot be used for practical
database applications. A practical verifiable database system must make trade-offs between
security, performance, and functionalities.

This workshop brings together researchers and engineers from academia and industry to
discuss ideas and techniques for practical verifiable database systems. The recent success
of blockchains offers exciting opportunities, which have led to several commercial systems
such as Amazon QLDB, Alibaba’s LedgerDB, and Azure SQLLedger. At the same time, the
low performance of existing blockchains presents a major challenge in designing a secure
and efficient system. We hope this workshop will identify new abstractions, systems,
challenges, and solutions that improve state-of-the-art verifiable database systems.
