This workshop brings together researchers and engineers from academia and industry to discuss  ideas and techniques for
practical verifiable database systems. The recent success of blockchains offers exciting opportunities, which have led
to several commercial systems such as Amazon QLDB, Alibabaâ€™s LedgerDB, and Azure SQLLedger. At the same time, the low
performance of existing blockchains presents a major challenge in designing a secure and efficient system. We hope this
workshop will identify new abstractions,  systems, challenges, and solutions that improve state-of-the-art verifiable
database systems. 

The topics of interest include, but not restricted to, the following:

* Hybrid database-blockchain systems
* Evaluation, benchmarking of verifiable database systems
* Blockchain designs and systems
* Database verifiability
* Transparency-based systems and techniques
* Verifiable primitives
* Novel use cases for verifiable database systems
* Database techniques for blockchains
* Dataset and real workloads for verifiable database systems
* Vision of new challenges or solutions related to verifiable database systems
